# Diabetes-Analysis
This project uses diabetes dataset to research about diabetes in a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). 

**Problem Statement:**

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.

The main objective of this project is to analyze the various factors that contribute to diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe. The data will be analyzed using EDA techniques, and models will be built to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the available data.

**Dataset Information:**

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)

**Installation Instructions**

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

**You can install these libraries using pip or conda.** 

- To install using pip, open your terminal and type the following commands:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn 

- To install using conda, type the following command:
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn 

**Usage Instructions**
After installing the required libraries, you can run the project by opening the Jupyter Notebook file and running the cells in order. The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step, including data cleaning, EDA, and model building.
